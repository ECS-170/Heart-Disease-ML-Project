# Heart-Disease-ML-Project
Collaborative group project that applies ML techniques to analyze Heart Disease.


I suggest downloading the desktop app for github to work from. 
In order to make changes to the current project, you will just need to create a branch (ctrl + shift + n) of the main.
Once done, name the branch with some kind of signifier. You should now have access to copies of all the files in the repository.
You can make changes on your own. When you are ready to add them back to the main project, you can publish the branch and make a pull request.
Once a pull request has been made, everyone in the group will be able to review the changes/additions you have made. If everything looks good,
we can then merge branches which will add all the changes to main branch. At this point all future branch request will include these new changes.
